Install and setup [unattended-upgrades](https://launchpad.net/unattended-upgrades) for Ubuntu and Debian, to periodically install security upgrades.

### Notes

1. If you have used version `0.0.1` of the role, you can delete the file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic` as it is not needed anymore. You can use the following one-shot command:
    * `ansible -m file -a "state=absent path=/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic" <host-pattern>`
2. If you have used this role before version `2.0.0`, the files `20auto-upgrades` and `50unattended-upgrades` will differ from the system defaults (instead of configuration being placed in a separate file, as we do now). These can be left as-is as they will be overridden. During OS upgrades, when asked if these files should be overwritten by the maintainer's package, say yes. They will then be reset to their default states, and you won't be asked these questions again.

## Requirements

The role uses [apt module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html) which has additional dependencies.

If you set `unattended_mail` to an e-mail address, make sure `mailx` command is available and your system is able to send e-mails.

The role requires unattended-upgrades version 0.70 and newer, which is available since Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu 12.04 respectively. This is due to [Origins Patterns](#origins-patterns) usage; if this is not available on your system, you may use [the first version of the role](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/tree/v0.1).

### Automatic Reboot

If you enable automatic reboot feature (`unattended_automatic_reboot`), the role will attempt to install `update-notifier-common` package, which is required on some systems for detecting and executing reboot after the upgrade. You may optionally define a specific time for rebooting (`unattended_automatic_reboot_time`).

This feature was broken in Debian Jessie, but eventually was rolled into the unattended-upgrades package; see [the discussion in #6](https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/6) for more details.

## Disabled Cron Jobs

On some hosts you may find that the unattended-upgrade's cron file `/etc/cron.daily/apt` file has been renamed to `apt.disabled`. This is possibly provider's decision, to save some CPU cycles. Use [enable-standard-cronjobs](https://github.com/Yannik/ansible-role-enable-standard-cronjobs) role to re-enable unattended-upgrades. See also discussion in [#9](https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/9).

## Origins Patterns

Origins Pattern is a more powerful alternative to the Allowed Origins option used in previous versions of unattended-upgrade.

Pattern is composed of specific keywords:

* `a`,`archive`,`suite` – e.g. `stable`, `trusty-security` (`archive=stable`)
* `c`,`component`   – e.g. `main`, `crontrib`, `non-free` (`component=main`)
* `l`,`label` – e.g. `Debian`, `Debian-Security`, `Ubuntu`
* `o`,`origin` – e.g. `Debian`, `Unofficial Multimedia Packages`, `Ubuntu`
* `n`,`codename` – e.g. `jessie`, `jessie-updates`, `trusty` (this is only supported with `unattended-upgrades` >= 0.80)
* `site` – e.g. `http.debian.net`

You can review the available repositories using `apt-cache policy` and debug your choice using `unattended-upgrades -d` command on a target system.

Additionally, unattended-upgrades support two macros (variables), derived from `/etc/debian_version`:

* `${distro_id}` – Installed distribution name, e.g. `Debian` or `Ubuntu`.
* `${distro_codename}` – Installed codename, e.g. `bullseye` or `jammy`.

Using `${distro_codename}` should be preferred over using `stable` or `oldstable` as a selected, as once `stable` moves to `oldstable`, no security updates will be installed at all, or worse, package from a newer distro release will be installed by accident. The same goes for upgrading your installation from `oldstable` to `stable`, if you forget to change this in your origin patterns, you may not receive the security updates for your newer distro release. With `${distro_codename}`, both cases can never happen.

## Systemd timers

Documentation for systemd/Timers: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd/Timers>

### Debian Default Configuration

* Download daily at random times during the entire day.
* Install daily between 6am - 7am

```yaml
unattended_systemd_timer_override: false # (default)
# apt-daily timer
unattended_apt_daily_oncalendar: "*-*-* 6,18:00" # (default)
unattended_apt_daily_randomizeddelaysec: "12h" # (default)
# apt-daily-upgrade timer
unattended_apt_daily_upgrade_oncalendar: "*-*-* 6:00" # (default)
unattended_apt_daily_upgrade_randomizeddelaysec: "60m" # (default)
```

### Customized download and update timers

* Download starts between 00:30am - 01:30am
* Installation starts between 04:00am - 05:30am

```yaml
unattended_systemd_timer_override: true
# apt-daily timer
unattended_apt_daily_oncalendar: "*-*-* 00:30"
unattended_apt_daily_randomizeddelaysec: "60m"

# apt-daily-upgrade timer
unattended_apt_daily_upgrade_oncalendar: "*-*-* 4:00"
unattended_apt_daily_upgrade_randomizeddelaysec: "90m"
```

## Role Usage Examples

Example for Ubuntu, with custom [origins patterns](#patterns-examples), blacklisted packages and e-mail notification:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
  - role: hifis.unattended_upgrades
    unattended_origins_patterns:
    - 'origin=Ubuntu,archive=${distro_codename}-security'
    - 'o=Ubuntu,a=${distro_codename}-updates'
    unattended_package_blacklist: [cowsay, vim]
    unattended_mail: 'root@example.com'
```

_Note:_ You don't need to specify `unattended_origins_patterns`, the role will use distribution's default if the variable is not set.

### Running Only on Debian-based Systems

If you manage multiple distribution with the same playbook, you may want to skip running this role on non-Debian systems. You can [use `when` conditional with role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#conditionals-with-roles) to limit the role to particular systems:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
     - role: hifis.unattended_upgrades
       when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
```

See [#38](https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/pull/38) for discussion.

### Patterns Examples

By default, only security updates are allowed for both Ubuntu and Debian. You can add more patterns to allow unattended-updates install more packages automatically, however be aware that automated major updates may potentially break your system.

#### For Debian

```yaml
unattended_origins_patterns:
  - 'origin=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Debian-Security' # security updates
  - 'o=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Debian' # updates including non-security updates
  - 'o=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},a=proposed-updates'
```

#### For Ubuntu

In Ubuntu, archive always contains the distribution codename

```yaml
unattended_origins_patterns:
  - 'origin=Ubuntu,archive=${distro_codename}-security'
  - 'o=Ubuntu,a=${distro_codename}'
  - 'o=Ubuntu,a=${distro_codename}-updates'
  - 'o=Ubuntu,a=${distro_codename}-proposed-updates'
```

#### For Raspbian

In Raspbian, it is only possible to update all packages from the default repository, including non-security updates, or updating none.

Updating all, including non-security:

```yaml
unattended_origins_patterns:
  - 'origin=Raspbian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Raspbian'
```

To not install any updates on a raspbian host, just set `unattended_origins_patterns` to an empty list:

```yaml
unattended_origins_patterns: []
```
