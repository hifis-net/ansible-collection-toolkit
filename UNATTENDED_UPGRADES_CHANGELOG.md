## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/tree/v2.0.0) (2022-12-02)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/compare/v1.12.2...v2.0.0)

**UPGRADE NOTES AND BREAKING CHANGES:**

If you have used this role before version 2.0.0, the files `20auto-upgrades` and `50unattended-upgrades` will differ from the system defaults (instead of the configuration being placed in a separate file, as we do now).
These can be left as-is as they will be overridden.
During OS upgrades, when asked if these files should be overwritten by the maintainer's package, say yes.
They will then be reset to their default states, and you won't be asked these questions again.

**Implemented enhancements:**

- \[Feature Request\] Use force\_apt\_get [\#32](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/32)
- Override configuration in a separate apt.conf.d file [\#10](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/10)
- Test role via Molecule [\#8](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/8)

- Fix installation of powermgmt-base package [\#35](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/35)

- Documentation role name mismatch [\#41](https://github.com/hifis-net/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades/issues/41)
